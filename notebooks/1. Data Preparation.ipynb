    "> *This notebook works well with the `Python 3 (Data Science)` kernel on SageMaker Studio*\n",
    "\n",
    "[**LayoutLM** (2019, Xu et al)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13318) is a BERT-like language model architecture in which the *position embedding* inputs (usually encoding the position of each word/token in the input sequence, as detailed in [this paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=onxoVA9FxMw)) are modified to encode the **absolute position of the word/token on a page**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Architectures like this enable us to build ML models which are aware of both *text content* and *page position*: especially useful for analyzing and post-processing OCR results from services like [Amazon Textract](https://aws.amazon.com/textract/), which returns both the detected text and the geometry of each word in the input document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since LayoutLM is based on a standard multi-task text transformer architecture with customizations to the input processing layer, this approach could be generalized to a wide range of task types using both text and position information, like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Self-supervised\" pre-training on Textracted but otherwise unlabelled documents\n",
    "- Document/page/sequence classification\n",
    "- Entity extraction (token/word classification)\n",
    "- Span extraction and extractive question answering\n",
    "- \"Translation\", generative question answering or other sequence generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these use cases (notably pre-training, sequence classification and token/word classification) are already supported in the LayoutLM [implementation](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/layoutlm.html) provided in the popular open source [Hugging Face Transformers library](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/layoutlm.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this sample we'll review an example use case where Amazon Textract's [built-in functionality](https://aws.amazon.com/textract/features/) for extracting key-value \"Forms\" data and structured \"Tables\" data helps with some examples... But misses others due to the complexity of the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first notebook will focus on preparing and annotating data, before we move on to training, deploying, and integrating models in later notebooks."
